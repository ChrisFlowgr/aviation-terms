        "whatItIs": { "content": "The takeoff decision speed. At or below V1 a rejected takeoff may be initiated; at or above V1 the takeoff is continued. V1 is computed using certified performance methods considering runway length, aircraft weight, and environmental conditions." },
        "howItWorks": { "content": "V1 is derived from approved performance data to satisfy accelerate-stop and accelerate-go requirements. Operators use AFM or performance tools so stopping or continuing from a critical point remains within limits." },
        "whatYouShouldDo": { "content": "Before departure, confirm V1 against current weight, runway, and conditions. Brief reject criteria below V1 and continue above V1 unless a catastrophic failure occurs. Monitor callouts and cross-check instruments." },
        "troubleshooting": { "content": "If V1 looks inconsistent, recheck weight, pressure altitude, temperature, runway state, contamination, MEL/CDL penalties, and any derate or assumed temperature." }
